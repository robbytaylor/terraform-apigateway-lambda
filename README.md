# Terraform API Gateway Lambda module

This Terraform module creates an AWS API Gateway with Lambda proxy itegration and, optional, custom domain.

Use this module to easily deploy a NodeJS application to AWS.

For an example of using this module, see https://github.com/robbytaylor/slack-secret-message/blob/master/terraform/main.tf

In order to create a Lambda function placeholder code is needed.
This repo currently contains placeholder code for NodeJS 10.x but no other runtimes.
PRs for other runtimes would be happily accepted!
